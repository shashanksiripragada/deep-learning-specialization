    "Welcome to this week's programming assignment. Until now, you've always used numpy to build neural networks. Now we will step you through a deep learning framework that will allow you to build neural networks more easily. Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle, Torch, Caffe, Keras, and many others can speed up your machine learning development significantly. All of these frameworks also have a lot of documentation, which you should feel free to read. In this assignment, you will learn to do the following in TensorFlow: \n",

    "This is where you become grateful to programming frameworks. All the backpropagation and the parameters update is taken care of in 1 line of code. It is very easy to incorporate this line in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you compute the cost function. You will create an \"`optimizer`\" object. You have to call this object along with the cost when running the tf.session. When called, it will perform an optimization on the given cost with the chosen method and learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, for gradient descent the optimizer would be:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate = learning_rate).minimize(cost)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the optimization you would do:\n",

    "_ , c = sess.run([optimizer, cost], feed_dict={X: minibatch_X, Y: minibatch_Y})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This computes the backpropagation by passing through the tensorflow graph in the reverse order. From cost to inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** When coding, we often use `_` as a \"throwaway\" variable to store values that we won't need to use later. Here, `_` takes on the evaluated value of `optimizer`, which we don't need (and `c` takes the value of the `cost` variable). "
